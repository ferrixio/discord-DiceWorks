:dragon: Author: Samuele Ferri (@ferrixio, ferri#9207)

:star: Version 3.6.0

## Requirements

Python 3.10 and Discord.py 2.3.1

## Story

This bot was created in 2021, a year after the beginning of the covid, and after my firts steps in the world of role-play games. Me and my friends were using [Dice Maiden bot](https://alternative.me/discord/bots/dice-maiden) during our sessions, but sometimes we needed some features that this bot doesn't have.
So I decide to write my own Dice Maiden using python and that how Dice Generator (or Dama Fortuna for us) was born!

Most of bot's answers are in italian, because me and friends' of mine are italian, but the code is written in english.

I'm thankful to Daniel (@Scarlet06) and Flavio, two friends of mine, for their help.

## Features

This bot can do many things:

    > simple rolls
    > advantage & disavantage rolls
    > saving throws
    > toss coins
    > stats and sizes generator for D&ampD 5e
    > explosive rolls

Dice Generator is currently run on a server, and if you want to add to your server (and also customize it) just write to me.

Main feature of the bot is roll dice in the following way:

`!tira 1d20+3 2d10-1` -> `Tiro di ferrixio:  [1], [3, 3],  totale: [4, 5]`

Moreover you can invoke commands again by reply to it with the command `!redo`.

The bot is also responsible to send a welcome message and count members in [OtakusHouse server](https://discord.gg/9e4HPeWhbf).
