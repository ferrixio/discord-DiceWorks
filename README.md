###  Discord bot to roll dice for rpg like D&amp;D

:dragon: Author: Samuele Ferri ([@ferrixio](https://github.com/ferrixio), ferri#9207)

:star: Version 4.2.0

## Requirements

Python 3.10 and Discord.py 2.3.1

## Story

This bot was created in 2021, a year after the beginning of the covid, and after my firts steps in the world of role-play games. Me and my friends were using [Dice Maiden bot](https://alternative.me/discord/bots/dice-maiden) during our sessions, but sometimes we needed some features that this bot doesn't have.
So I decide to write my own Dice Maiden using python and that's how DiceWorks (or Dama Fortuna for us) was born!

Most of bot's answers are in italian, because me and friends' of mine are italian, but the code is written in english.

I'm thankful to Daniel ([@Scarlet06](https://github.com/Scarlet06)) and Flavio, two friends of mine, for their help.

## Features

This bot can do many things:

    > simple rolls
    > advantage & disavantage rolls
    > saving throws
    > toss coins
    > character creation for D&ampD 5e
    > explosive rolls
    
and much more!

If you want to add **DiceWorks** to your server (and also customize it) just write to me.

Main feature of the bot is roll dice in the following way: `!tira 1d20+3 2d10-1` -> `Tiro di ferrixio:  [1], [3, 3] -> [4, 5]`
